<h2>QCD Processes</h2>

This section is subdivided into soft and hard QCD processes, with
open charm and bottom production set aside as a special part of the
latter. 

<h3>Soft QCD processes</h3>

As a rule, the processes in this class should not be mixed with
the simulation of other processes. All by themselves, they are
intended to represent the total cross section of hadron collisions,
with the exception of the "rare processes" that one wishes to study
separately. In particular, jet physics at all scales occurs as part 
of the minimum-bias description. 

<p/>
We here use the "minimum bias" expression as a shorthand for 
inelastic, nondiffractive events. Strictly speaking, "minimum bias" 
represents an experimental procedure of accepting "everything", with 
some non-universal cuts to exclude elastic and diffractive topologies. 
In practice, the experimental mimimum-bias sample may then contain
some contamination of what is in PYTHIA classified as diffractive,
especially (high-mass) double diffractive. 

<p/><strong>
flag name="SoftQCD:all" default="off"
</strong><br/>
Common switch for the group of all soft QCD processes, 
as listed separately in the following.
  

<p/><strong>
flag name="SoftQCD:minBias" default="off"
</strong><br/>
Minimum-bias events, based on an eikonalized description of all the 
hard QCD processes, so includes them in combinationation with 
low-<i>pT</i> events. Code 101.<br/>
Since the current description is handled by the multiple-interactions 
machinery as part of the parton-level processing, no hard process at 
all is defined at the process-level part of the event generation.
Fortunately, in this case a special 
<a href="EventInformation.html" target="page"><code>codeSub()</code></a> 
method provides information on the first, i.e. hardest, subprocess 
selected by the multiple-interactions machinery.

  

<p/><strong>
flag name="SoftQCD:elastic" default="off"
</strong><br/>
Elastic scattering <i>A B -> A B</i>.
Code 102.
  

<p/><strong>
flag name="SoftQCD:singleDiffractive" default="off"
</strong><br/>
Single diffractive scattering <i>A B -> X B</i> and 
<i>A B -> A X</i>. 
Codes 103 and 104.
  

<p/><strong>
flag name="SoftQCD:doubleDiffractive" default="off"
</strong><br/>
Double diffractive scattering <i>A B -> X_1 X_2</i>.
Code 105.
  

<h3>Hard QCD processes</h3>

This group contains the processes for QCD jet production above
some minimum <i>pT</i> threshold, as opposed to the minimum-bias
process above, where all <i>pT</i> scales can be probed. 
The <i>pT_min</i> cut cannot be put too low, or else unreasonably
large jet cross sections will be obtained.
  
<p/><strong>
flag name="HardQCD:all" default="off"
</strong><br/>
Common switch for the group of all hard QCD processes, 
as listed separately in the following.
  

<p/><strong>
flag name="HardQCD:gg2gg" default="off"
</strong><br/>
Scatterings <i>g g -> g g</i>.
Code 111.
  

<p/><strong>
flag name="HardQCD:gg2qqbar" default="off"
</strong><br/>
Scatterings <i>g g -> q qbar</i>.
Code 112.
  

<p/><strong>
flag name="HardQCD:qg2qg" default="off"
</strong><br/>
Scatterings <i>q g -> q g</i> and <i>qbar g -> qbar g</i>.
Code 113.
  

<p/><strong>
flag name="HardQCD:qq2qq" default="off"
</strong><br/>
Scatterings <i>q q' -> q q'</i>, <i>q qbar' -> q qbar'</i>, 
<i>qbar qbar' -> qbar qbar'</i>, where <i>q'</i> and <i>q</i> 
may agree, but the outgoing flavours equals the incoming ones 
Codes 114, 115 and 116.
  

<p/><strong>
flag name="HardQCD:qqbar2qqbarNew" default="off"
</strong><br/>
Scatterings <i>q qbar -> q' qbar'</i>, where the outgoing flavours 
are different from the incoming ones. 
Code 117.
  

<p/><strong>
flag name="HardQCD:qqbar2gg" default="off"
</strong><br/>
Scatterings <i>q qbar -> g g</i>. 
Code 118.
  

<h3>Hard QCD processes: heavy-flavour subset</h3>

These processes form a natural part of the above class, but can
also be generated separately. Formally the heavy-quark mass makes
these matrix elements finite in the <i>pT -> 0</i> limit, but at
high energies one may still question the validity of the expressions
at low <i>pT</i> values, like for the other hard-QCD processes.  

<p/><strong>
flag name="HardQCD:gg2ccbar" default="off"
</strong><br/>
Scatterings <i>g g -> c cbar</i>. 
Code 121.
  

<p/><strong>
flag name="HardQCD:qqbar2ccbar" default="off"
</strong><br/>
Scatterings <i>q qbar -> c cbar</i>. 
Code 122.
  

<p/><strong>
flag name="HardQCD:gg2bbbar" default="off"
</strong><br/>
Scatterings <i>g g -> b bbar</i>. 
Code 123.
  

<p/><strong>
flag name="HardQCD:qqbar2bbbar" default="off"
</strong><br/>
Scatterings <i>q qbar -> b bbar</i>. 
Code 124.
