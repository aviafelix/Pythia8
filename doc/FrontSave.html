<h1>PYTHIA 8</h1>

<h2>Welcome to PYTHIA - The Lund Monte Carlo!</h2>

<p/>
<code>PYTHIA 8</code> is still at an early stage, and should not be 
used for any production runs. What is offered here is only a snapshot, 
to allow interested users to provide feedback on the basic structure. 
The program is under active development, however, and is intended to 
replace the existing <code>PYTHIA 6</code> within the next few years.

<p/>
Use the left-hand index to navigate in the existing documentation, 
e.g. to learn with flags, modes and parameters can be set by the user.
Also note that a separate brief introduction exists (as a pdf file), 
that offers the best way to get to understand the basic structure of 
<code>PYTHIA 8</code>. The current pages offer the more detailed picture, 
with the corresponding danger of then losing overview.
