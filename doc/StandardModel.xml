<h2>Standard-Model Parameters</h2>

<h3>The strong coupling</h3> 

Currently the only class in this category is <code>AlphaStrong</code>, 
which is used to provide a first- or second-order running 
<ei>alpha_strong</ei> (or, trivially, a zeroth-order fixed one). 
Formulae are the standard ones found in [1]. The starting 
<ei>alpha_strong</ei> value is defined at the <ei>M_Z</ei> mass scale.
The <ei>Lambda</ei> values are matched at the <ei>b</ei> and <ei>c</ei> 
flavour thresholds, such that <ei>alpha_strong</ei> is continuous, 
using an approximate iterative method for second-order matching.
Since we allow <ei>alpha_strong</ei> to vary separately for 
hard processes, timelike showers, spacelike showers and  multiple 
interactions, the relevant values are to be set in each of these classes. 
 
<p/>
The <ei>alpha_strong</ei> calculation is initialized by 
<code>init( value, order)</code>, where <code>value</code> 
is the <ei>alpha_strong</ei> value at <ei>M_Z</ei> and <code>order</code> 
is the order of the running, 0, 1 or 2.   Thereafter the value can be 
calculated by <code>alphaS(scale)</code>, where 
<code>scale</code> is the <ei>Q^2</ei> scale in GeV^2. 

<p/>
For applications inside shower programs, a second-order <code>alpha_s</code> 
value can be obtained as the product of the two functions 
<code>alphaS1Ord(scale)</code> and <code>alphaS2OrdCorr(scale)</code>, 
where the first gives a simple first-order running (but with the 
second-order <ei>Lambda</ei>) and the second the correction factor, 
below unity, for the second-order terms. This allows a compact handling 
of evolution equations.

<h3>Electroweak couplings</h3> 

In addition, this section contains a few further parameters that should
normally not be touched.

<parameter name="StandardModel:alphaEMfix" default="0.00729735"
min="0.00729" max="0.00730">
Fixed <ei>alpha_em</ei> value used in QED vertices. 
</parameter>

<parameter name="StandardModel:sin2thetaW" default="0.232" 
min="0.225" max="0.240">
The weak mixing angle.
</parameter>

<p/>
Eventually will appear a running <ei>alpha_em</ei>, and CKM matrix elements.
