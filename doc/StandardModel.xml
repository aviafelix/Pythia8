<h1>Standard-Model Parameters</h1>

<h2>The strong coupling</h2> 

Currently the only class in this category is <ci>AlphaStrong</ci>, 
which is used to provide a first- or second-order running 
<ei>alpha_strong</ei> (or, trivially, a zeroth-order fixed one). 
Formulae are the standard ones found in [1]. The starting 
<ei>alpha_strong</ei> value is defined at the <ei>M_Z</ei> mass scale.
The <ei>Lambda</ei> values are matched at the <ei>b</ei> and <ei>c</ei> 
flavour thresholds, such that <ei>alpha_strong</ei> is continuous, 
using an approximate iterative method for second-order matching.
Since we allow <ei>alpha_strong</ei> to vary separately for timelike 
showers, spacelike showers and  multiple interactions, the relevant 
values are to be set in each of these classes. 
 
<p/>
The <ei>alpha_strong</ei> calculation is initialized by 
<ci>AlphaStrong::init( value, order)</ci>, where <ci>value</ci> 
is the <ei>alpha_strong</ei> value at <ei>M_Z</ei> and <ci>order</ci> 
is the order of the running, 0, 1 or 2.   Thereafter the value can be 
calculated by <ci>alphaS(scale)</ci>, where 
<ci>scale</ci> is the <ei>Q^2</ei> scale in GeV^2>. 

<p/>
For applications inside shower programs, a second-order <ci>alpha_s</ci> 
value can be obtained as the product of the two functions 
<ci>alphaS1Ord(scale)</ci> and <ci>alphaS2OrdCorr(scale)</ci>, where the 
first gives a simple first-order running (but with the second-order 
<ei>Lambda</ei>) and the second the correction factor, below unity, 
for the second-order terms. This allows a compact handling of evolution 
equations.

<h2>Electroweak couplings</h2> 

In addition, this section contains a few further parameters that should
normally not be touched.

<parameter name="StandardModel:alphaEMfix" default="0.00729735"
min="0.00729" max="0.00730">
Fixed <ei>alpha_em</ei> value used in QED vertices. 
</parameter>

<parameter name="StandardModel:sin2thetaW" default="0.232" 
min="0.225" max="0.240">
The weak mixing angle.
</parameter>

<p/>
Eventually will appear a running <ei>alpha_em</ei>, and CKM matrix elements.
