<h2>HepMC Interface</h2>

An interface to the HepMC <ref>Dob01</ref> standard event record 
format has been provided by M. Kirsanov. To use it, the relevant 
libraires need to be linked, as explained in the README file. The 
(simple) procedure to translate PYTHIA 8 events into HepMC ones 
is then illustrated in the <code>main11.c</code> main program.
