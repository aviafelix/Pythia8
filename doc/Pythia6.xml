<chapter name="Accessing Pythia6 Processes">

<h1>Accessing Pythia6 Processes</h1>

In order to give access to the Fortran Pythia process library
at runtime (and not only by writing/reading event files)
an interface is provided to C++. This interface is residing in 
<ci>Pythia6.h</ci>, while the ordinary Fortran code is in 
<ci>Pythia6.f</ci>. The latter should normally be the most recent 
Fortran Pythia version, but must be at least 6.314, since this is 
the first version that allows processes to be output in the Les 
Houches format (and not only input).

<p/>
The communication with Pythia6 is transparent to the user, and the
main choices are made in the <ci>Pythia</ci> class. It may be useful 
to understand what the interface can and cannot do, however.

<p/>
The normal <ci>Pythia</ci> routines <ci>readString</ci> and 
<ci>readFile</ci> can be used to modify the performance of the 
Pythia6 generator. The name of any variable must be preceded by 
<ci>Pythia6:</ci> to distinguish it from normal Pythia8 parameters,
either in the Settings or the ParticleDataTable classes. An example 
would be
<code>
    pythia.readString("Pythia6:ckin(3) = 10.")
</code> 
The first part is then peeled off, to give the string 
<ci>ckin(3) = 10.</ci>. This string is given as argument to 
<ci>pygive</ci>, accessed via the <ci>extern "C" pygive_</ci> 
interface. Thus all parameters that could be set with the 
<ci>PYGIVE</ci> Fortran routine can also be set by <ci>readString</ci> 
and <ci>readFile</ci>. Only those commands that influence the 
generation of the hard process have any impact, however, since this 
is the only part of the Fortran code that is used.

<p/>
The other routines interfaced are
<ul>
<li><ci>pyinit(...)</ci> to initialize the event generation 
chain,</li>
<li><ci>pyupev()</ci> to generate the next process,</li>
<li><ci>pylist(mode)</ci> to list the event at the process 
level,</li>
<li><ci>pystat(mode)</ci> to print statistics on the event 
generation process.</li>
</ul> 
The modes for the last two routines are as given in the Pythia 6.4
manual, and these two are the only ones a user might wish to access
directly.

<p/>
This means that all other Fortran routines have not been interfaced
and cannot be accessed directly from the C++ code; there is no need
for them in the current setup.

<p/>
All hard Pythia 6 processes should be available for full generation
in Pythia 8, at least to the extent that they are defined for beams 
of protons and antiprotons, which are the only ones fully implemented 
in Pythia 8 so far. Soft processes, i.e. elastic and diffractive 
scattering, as well as minimum-bias events, require a different 
kinematics machinery, and are not currently available.

<p/>
Finally, note that it is not possible to mix processes from Pythia6 
with those from Pythia8. If you give but a single command beginning 
with <ci>Pythia6:</ci>, even if not for a specific process, it is
assumed that Pythia6 should be used for all hard/process generation.
