<h2>Particle Decays</h2>

The <code>ParticleDecays</code> class performs the sequential decays of 
all unstable hadrons produced in the string fragmentation stage,
i.e. up to and including <ei>b</ei> hadrons and their decay products, 
such as the <ei>tau</ei> lepton. It is not to be used for the decay of 
more massive resonances, such as top, <ei>Z^0</ei> or SUSY, where decays 
must be performed already at the <code>ProcessLevel</code> of the event 
generation.

The decay description essentially copies the one present in 
PYTHIA since many years, currently with some simplifications 
for some charm and bottom channels, and updates will need to be
introduced eventually.

<h3>Variables determining whether a particle decays</h3>

Before a particle is actually decayed, a number of checks are made.

<p/>
(i) Decay modes must have been defined for the particle kind;    
tested by the <code>canDecay()</code> method of <code>Event</code> 
(and <code>ParticleData</code>).        

<p/>
(ii) The main switch for allowing this particle kind to decay must 
be on; tested by the <code>mayDecay()</code> method of <code>Event</code> 
(and <code>ParticleData</code>). 

<p/>
(iii) Particles may be requested to have a nominal proper lifetime 
<ei>tau0</ei> below a threshold.

<flag name="ParticleDecays:limitTau0" default="off">
When on, only particles with <ei>tau0 &lt; tau0Max</ei> are decayed.
</flag>

<parameter name="ParticleDecays:tau0Max" default="1." min="0.">
The above <ei>tau0Max</ei>, expressed in mm/c.
</parameter>

<p/>
(iv) Particles may be requested to have an actual proper lifetime 
<ei>tau</ei> below a threshold.

<flag name="ParticleDecays:limitTau" default="off">
When on, only particles with <ei>tau &lt; tauMax</ei> are decayed.
</flag>

<parameter name="ParticleDecays:tauMax" default="1." min="0."> 
The above <ei>tauMax</ei>, expressed in mm/c.<br/>
In order for this and the subsequent tests to work, a <ei>tau</ei> 
is selected and stored for each particle, whether in the end it
decays or not. (If each test would use a different temporary 
<ei>tau</ei> it would lead to inconsistencies.)
</parameter>

<p/>
(v) Particles may be requested to decay within a given distance 
of the origin.

<flag name="ParticleDecays:limitRadius" default="off">
When on, only particles with a decay within a radius <ei>r &lt; rMax</ei> 
are decayed. There is assumed to be no magnetic field or other 
detector effects.
</flag>

<parameter name="ParticleDecays:rMax" default="1." min="0.">
The above <ei>rMax</ei>, expressed in mm/c.
</parameter> 

<p/>
(vi) Particles may be requested to decay within a given cylidrical 
volume around the origin.

<flag name="ParticleDecays:limitCylinder" default="off">
When on, only particles with a decay within a volume limited by
<ei>rho = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) &lt; xyMax</ei> and <ei>|z| &lt; zMax</ei> 
are decayed. There is assumed to be no magnetic field or other 
detector effects.
</flag>

<parameter name="ParticleDecays:xyMax" default="1." min="0.">
The above <ei>xyMax</ei>, expressed in mm/c.
</parameter> 

<parameter name="ParticleDecays:zMax" default="1." min="0.">
The above <ei>zMax</ei>, expressed in mm/c.
</parameter> 

<h3>Mixing</h3>

<flag name="ParticleDecays:mixB" default="on">
Allow or not <ei>B^0 - B^0bar</ei> and <ei>B_s^0 - B_s^0bar</ei> mixing.
</flag>

<parameter name="ParticleDecays:xBdMix" default="0.771" 
min="0.70" max="0.85">
The mixing parameter <ei>x_d = Delta(m_B^0)/Gamma_B^0</ei> in the 
<ei>B^0 - B^0bar</ei> system.
</parameter> 

<parameter name="ParticleDecays:xBsMix" default="25.0" min="15.0"> 
The mixing parameter <ei>x_s = Delta(m_B_s^0)/Gamma_B_s^0</ei> in the 
<ei>B_s^0 - B_s^0bar</ei> system.
</parameter> 

<h3>Other variables</h3>

<parameter name="ParticleDecays:mSafety" default="0.001" 
min="0." max="0.01">
Minimum mass difference required between the decaying mother mass 
and the sum of the daughter masses, kept as a safety margin to avoid
numerical problems in the decay generation.
</parameter> 

<p/>
When a decay mode is defined in terms of a partonic content, a random 
multiplicity (and a random flavour set) of hadrons is to be picked, 
especially for some charm and bottom decays. This is done according to 
a Gaussian distribution, for <ei>n_q</ei> quarks centered at 
<ei>c + n_q/4</ei> and with a width <ei>sqrt(c)</ei>, with the final 
number rounded off to the nearest integer. Here
<eq>
   c = multIncrease * ln ( mDiff / multRefMass)
</eq>
with <ei>mDiff</ei> the difference between the decaying particle mass 
and the sum of the constituent quark masses. For gluonic systems 
<ei>multGoffset</ei> offers and optional additonal term to the 
multiplicity. There is always some lower limit for the allowed 
multiplicity; if a number smaller than this is picked the choice 
is repeated.
<parameter name="ParticleDecays:multIncrease" default="4.5" 
min="3." max="6.">
The above <ei>multIncrease</ei> parameter.
</parameter> 

<parameter name="ParticleDecays:multRefMass" default="0.7"
min="0.2" max="2.0">
The above <ei>multRefMass</ei> parameter.
</parameter> 

<parameter name="ParticleDecays:multGoffset" default="0.0" 
min="0.0" max="2.0">
The above <ei>multGoffset</ei> parameter.
</parameter> 

<parameter name="ParticleDecays:colRearrange" default="0.5" 
min="0." max="1.0">
When a decay is given as a list of four partons to be turned into
hadrons (i.e. for mode 11 - 30), it is assumed that they are listed
in pairs, as a first and a second colour singlet, which could give rise 
to separate sets of hadrons. Here <ei>colRearrange</ei> is the 
probability that this original assignment is not respected, and 
default corresponds to no memory of this original colour topology.
</parameter> 

<flag name="ParticleDecays:FSRinDecays" default="true">
When a particle decays to <ei>q qbar</ei>, <ei>g g</ei>, <ei>g g g</ei> 
or <ei>gamma g g</ei>, allow or not a shower to develop from it, before 
the partonic system is hadronized. (The typical example is 
<ei>Upsilon</ei> decay.)
</flag>

In addition, some variables defined for string fragmentation and for
flavour production are used also here.
