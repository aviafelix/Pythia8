<h2>Event Statistics</h2>

At the end of the run you will want to write out the final statistics
on number of events generated, the corresponding cross sections and 
the number of errors encountered. This is done with
<pre>
    pythia.statistics();
 </pre>
assuming <code>pythia</code> is an instance of the <code>Pythia</code>
class. The <code>statistics</code> method in its turn calls on the 
methods below.

<h3>Cross-section statistics</h3>

The <code>ProcessLevel::statistics()</code> member will loop over the
list of existing processes, and for each write out name, code,
the number of tried  and accepted events (in the sense that the 
Monte Carlo integration involves an initial upper estimate of the
cross section, that then is compensated by the try-accept/reject
step), the cross section and the estimated error on the latter. 

<p/> 
If PYTHIA 6 is used to generate the hard processes, instead the
Fortran <code>PYSTAT</code> method is called.

<h3>Error messages</h3>

The <code>ErrorMessages</code> class is rather small. It is handed any 
warning or error messages during the event generation phase, and will 
store each distinct message, with a counter for how many times it is 
issued. Thus it is possible to limit the number of identical messages 
issued. The summary table printed by <code>pythia.statistics()</code> 
provides a table with all the different messages issued, in 
alphabetical order, with the total number of times each was generated.

<p/>
There is only one mode affecting its operation:
<p/><strong>
mode name="ErrorMessages:timesToPrint" default="1" min="0"
</strong><br/>
The number of times each distinct message is printed. Thit is, by
default, each new kind of error/warning is only printed once.
