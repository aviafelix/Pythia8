<h2>Further Comments</h2>

This page contains a few further comments on scattered topics, that
(so far) did not find a better place to be located.

<h3>PythiaStdlib</h3> 

<code>PythiaStdlib</code> only exists as a header file, collecting all 
the <code>include</code> and <code>using</code> statements that 
are required by most other classes to access the C++ 
<code>Stdlib</code> containers and methods.

In addition, the file contains inline functions <code>pow2(x)</code>, 
<code>pow3(x)</code>, <code>pow4(x)</code> and <code>pow5(x)</code>,
for small integer powers, <code>sqrtpos(x)</code> where a 
<code>max(0., x)</code> ensures one does not take the square root of
a negative number, and <code>tolower(string)</code> that converts 
a whole string to lowercase characters (extending on the 
<code>tolower</code> fuction for a single character).
