<h1>Further Comments</h1>

This page contains a few further comments on scattered topics, that
(so far) did not find a better place to be located.

<h2>Stdlib</h2> 

<ci>Stdlib</ci> only exists as a header file, collecting all the 
<ci>include</ci> and <ci>using</ci> statements that are required 
by most other classes to access the C++ <ci>Stdlib</ci> containers 
and methods.

In addition, the file contains inline functions <ci>pow2(x)</ci>, 
<ci>pow3(x)</ci>, <ci>pow4(x)</ci> and <ci>pow5(x)</ci>, for small 
integer powers, <ci>sqrtpos(x)</ci> where a <ci>max(0., x)</ci> 
ensures one does not take the square root of a negative
number, and <ci>tolower(string)</ci> that converts a whole string 
to lowercase characters (extending on the <ci>tolower</ci> fuction 
for a single character).
