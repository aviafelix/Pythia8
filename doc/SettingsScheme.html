<h2>The Settings Scheme</h2>

The <code>Settings</code> class keeps track of all the flags, modes and 
parameters in the program. As such, it serves the other program elements 
from one central repository. It allows the user to modify the behaviour of 
the program. The <code>Settings</code> class is purely static, i.e. you can 
interact with it directly by <code>Settings::command(argument)</code>. 
However, a <code>settings</code> object of the <code>Settings</code> class 
is a public member of the <code>Pythia</code> class, so an alternative 
notation would be <code>pythia.settings.command(argument)</code>,
assuming that <code>pythia</code> is an instance of the <code>Pythia</code> 
class. Further, for the most frequent user tasks, <code>Pythia</code> 
methods have been defined, so that <code>pythia.command(argument)</code> 
would work, see further below.

<h3>Concepts</h3>

We distiguish three kinds of user-modifiable variables, by the way
they have to be stored:
<ol>
<li>Flags are on/off switches, and are stored as <code>bool</code>.</li>
<li>Modes corresponds to a finite enumeration of separate options,
   and are stored as <code>int</code>.</li>
<li>Parameters take a continuum of values, and are stored as 
<code>double</code>.</li>
</ol>
One could imagine also strings, but so far there has been no need.

<p/>
In general, each variable stored in <code>Settings</code> is associated 
with four kinds of information:
<ul>
<li>The variable name, of the form <code>class:name</code> 
(or <code>file:name</code>, usually these agree), e.g. 
<code>TimeShower:pTmin</code>. The class/file part usually identifies 
the <code>.xml</code> file where the variable is defined, and the part of 
the program where it is used, but such a connection cannot be strictly
upheld, since e.g. the same variable may be used in a few different
cases (even if most of them are not).</li> 
<li>The default value, set in the original declaration, and intended
to represent a reasonable choice.</li> 
<li>The current value, which differs from the default when the user so 
requests.</li>
<li>An allowed range of values, represented by meaningful
minimum and maximum values. This has no sense for a <code>flag</code> 
(and is not used there), is usually rather well-defined for a 
<code>mode</code>, but less so for a <code>parameter</code>. Often the 
allowed range exaggerates the degree of our current knowledge, so as not to 
restrict too much what the user can do. One may choose not to set the 
lower or upper limit, in which case the range is open-ended.</li>   
</ul>

<p/>
Technically, the <code>Settings</code> class is implemented with the 
help of three separate maps, one for each kind of variable, with the 
variable <code>name</code> used as key. 

<h3>Operation</h3>
    
The normal flow of setting value is:

<ol>

<li>When a <code>Pythia</code> object <code>pythia </code>is created, 
the member <code>pythia.settings</code> is asked to scan the files
listed in the <code>Index.xml</code> file in the <code>doc</code> 
subdirectory.
</li>

<li>In all of the files scanned, lines beginning with 
<code>&lt;flag></code>, <code>&lt;mode></code> or 
<code>&lt;parameter></code> are identified, and the information on 
such a line is used to define 
a new flag, mode or parameter. To exemplify, consider a line
<pre>
&lt;parameter name="TimeShower:pTmin" default="0.5" min="0.1" max="2.0">
</pre> 
which appears in the <code>TimeShower.xml</code> file, and there
defines a parameter <code>TimeShower:pTmin</code> with default value 
0.5 GeV and allowed variation in the range 0.1 - 2.0 GeV. The min 
and max values are optional.
<br/><b>Important:</b> the values in the <code>.xml</code> files should 
not be changed, except by the PYTHIA authors. Any changes should be 
done with the help of the methods described below.</li>

<li>Between the creation of the <code>Pythia</code> object and the 
<code>init</code> call for it, you may use the methods of the 
<code>Settings</code> class to modify some of the default values. 
Several different methods can be used for this.

<p/> 
a) Inside your main program you can directly set values with
<pre>
    pythia.settings.readString(string) 
</pre>
where both the variable name and the value are contained inside
the character string, separated by blanks and/or a =, e.g. 
<pre>
    pythia.settings.readString("TimeShower:pTmin = 1.0"); 
</pre>
The match of the name to the database is case-insensitive. Names 
that do not match an existing variable are ignored. A warning is
printed, however, unless an optional second argument <code>false</code> 
is used. Values below the minimum or above the maximum are set at 
the respective border. For <code>bool</code> values, the following 
notation may be used interchangeably: 
<code>true = on = yes = ok = 1</code>, while everything else gives 
<code>false</code> (including but not limited to 
<code>false</code>, <code>off</code>, <code>no</code> and 0).<br/> 

The <code>Pythia</code> class contains a <code>readString</code> method 
that hands on to this method, or to corresponding methods in 
<code>ParticleData</code> or <code>Pythia6</code>, and therefore may offer 
the most convenient form:
<pre>
    pythia.readString("TimeShower:pTmin = 1.0"); 
</pre>

<p/> 
b) Underlying this are the settings-type-sensitive commands in 
<code>Settings</code>, that are split by names containing <code>flag</code>, 
<code>mode</code> or <code>parameter.</code> Thus, the example now reads
<pre>
    pythia.settings.parameter("TimeShower:pTmin", 1.0); 
</pre>
Boolean values should here be given as <code>true</code> or 
<code>false</code> i.e. there is less flexibility in the lower-level 
methods.<br/> 

There are several different further methods, like 
<p/><strong>
method name="mode( name)" 
</strong><br/>
gives the current value,
  
<p/><strong>
method name="mode( name, value)" 
</strong><br/>
sets the current value,
  
<p/><strong>
method name="isMode( name)" 
</strong><br/>
tells whether a mode has been defined or not,
  
<p/><strong>
method name="addMode( name, default, min, max)" 
</strong><br/>
defines a new mode,
  
<p/><strong>
method name="forceMode( name, value)" 
</strong><br/>
sets the value, also when outside the recommended bounds (and it is 
completely up to you to face the consequences),
  
<p/><strong>
method name="resetMode( name)" 
</strong><br/>
resets the current value to the default one.
  

<p/>
Corresponding methods exist for flags and parameters.
Again name comparisons are case-insensitive.

<p/> 
Normally the user should have no need for these methods. The 
main exception is if some of the variables defined on 
Main Program Parameters page are used to set run-specific information 
(like the CM energy or the number of events to generate) in an external 
file (see 3c below) and these variables are then read into the main 
program. Then the <code>flag( name)</code>, <code>mode( name)</code> and 
<code>parameter( name)</code> methods are to be used, see 
<code>main01.cc</code> as an example how it could work.

<p/>
c) A simpler and more useful way is to collect all your changes
in a separate file, with one line per change, e.g. 
<pre>
    TimeShower:pTmin = 1.0
</pre>
Each line is process as described for the string in 3a). Since names 
that do not match an existing variable are ignored, you can easily 
comment out lines. The recommended way would be to add a special 
character like # or ! in the first column. 

The file can be read by the 
<pre>
    pythia.settings.readFile("filename") 
</pre>
method, alternatively by the 
<pre>
    pythia.readFile("filename") 
</pre>
method. The latter has the advantage that it allows you to freely mix 
commands to the <code>Settings</code>, <code>ParticleData</code> and 
<code>Pythia6</code> classes, and so is preferable. Again, an optional 
second argument <code>false</code> allows you to switch off warning messages 
for unknown variables.</li>

<li>In the <code>Pythia init</code> call, many of the various other program  
elements are initialized, making use of the values in the database. 
Once initialized, the common <code>Settings</code> database may not be 
consulted again. It is therefore not productive to do further changes in 
mid-run. 

<p/>
A routine <code>reInit("filename")</code> is provided, and can be used to 
zero all the maps and reinitialize  from scratch. Such a call might be 
required if several <code>Pythia</code> objects are created in the same run, 
and requested to have different values - by default the <code>init()</code> 
call is only made the first time. However, a more economical solution 
is then offered by <code>resetAll()</code>, which sets all variables to 
their default values.</li> 

<li>You may at any time obtain a listing of all variables in the 
database by calling  
<pre>
    pythia.settings.listAll();
</pre>
The listing is strictly alphabetical, which at least means that names
from the same file are kept together, but otherwise may not be so 
well-structured: important and unimportant ones will appear mixed.
A more relevant alternative is 
<pre>
    pythia.settings.listChanged();
</pre>
where you will only get those variables that differ from their 
defaults. Or you can use 
<pre>
    pythia.settings.list("string");
</pre>
where only those variables with names that contain the string 
(case-insensitive match) are listed. Thus, with a string 
<code>shower</code>, the shower-related variables would be shown.
</li>

</ol>
