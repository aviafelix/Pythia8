<h1>PYTHIA 8</h1>

<h2>Welcome to PYTHIA - The Lund Monte Carlo!</h2>

<p/>
PYTHIA 8 is still at an early stage, and should not be 
used for any production runs. What is offered here is only a snapshot, 
to allow interested users to provide feedback on the basic structure. 
The program is under active development, however, and is intended to 
replace the existing PYTHIA 6 within the next few years.

<p/>
Use the left-hand index to navigate in the existing documentation, 
e.g. to learn which flags, modes and parameters can be set by the user.
Also note that there is a separate
<a href="pythia8051.pdf" target="page"><b>Brief Introduction</b></a>
(as a pdf file), 
that offers the best way to get to understand the basic structure of 
PYTHIA 8. The current pages offer the more detailed picture, 
with the corresponding danger of then losing overview.  

<p/>
The complete <b>PYTHIA 6.4 Physics and Manual</b>, published in<br/>
<b>T. Sj&ouml;strand, S. Mrenna and P. Skands, JHEP05 (2006) 026</b>,<br/>
in detail describes the physics (partly) implemented also in 
PYTHIA 8. It therefore is the main reference that you should
quote, whether you use PYTHIA 6 or PYTHIA 8.
