<h2>Save/Restore Parameters</h2>

This is the crucial page, where the real action is to occur,
once the Graphical User Interface is up and running.

<p/>
In a window you can specify a filename (including directory)
where all flag/mode/parameter/word changes on all the other pages
are written out, one change per line, in the form
name-of-flag/mode/parameter/word = value 

<p/>
This writing will occur when you click on a button.   

<p/>
It would also be helpful to have the the ability to restore 
everything to the default values, in case one wants to start 
all over.

<p/>
Ultimately it would be great also to read in an existing file
of already-saved changes and propagate those changes to the
"current values" displayed on the other pages, as a start for
any other further changes one may wish to do.
