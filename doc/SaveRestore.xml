<h1>Save/Restore Parameters</h1>

<!--

This is the crucial page, where the real action is to occur.

In a window you can specify a filename (including directory)
where all flag/mode/parameter changes on all the other pages
are written out, one change per line, in the form
name-of-flag/mode/parameter = value 

This writing will occur when you click on a button.   

It would also be helpful to have the the ability to restore 
everything to the default values, in case one wants to start 
all over.

Ultimately it would be great also to read in an existing file
of already-saved changes and propagate those changes to the
"current values" displayed on the other pages, as a start for
any other further changes one may wish to do.
