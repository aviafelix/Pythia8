<h2>Generic Settings</h2>

Here are collected a few scattered topics, controlled from the 
main <code>Pythia</code> class.

<h3>Parton densities</h3>

There is one main physics choice to be made with the <code>Pythia</code> 
class, namely which parton densities to use, a choice that then is 
propagated through the program. The simplest option is to pick one 
of the few distributions available internally:

<p/><strong>
mode name="Pythia:pPDFset" default="2" min="1" max="2"
</strong><br/>
Parton densities to be used for proton beams (and, by implication,
antiproton ones):
<br/><strong>
option value="1"</strong>: GRV 94 L;  
<br/><strong>
option value="2"</strong>: CTEQ 5 L.  
   

<p/>
Obviously this choice is mainly intended to get going, and a much wider 
selection could be used by linking to 
<a href="PartonDistributions.html" target="page">an external library</a>.

<p/>
For electrons/leptons there is no need to choose, since only one 
implementation is available, and should be rather uncontroversial
(apart from some technical details).

<h3>Random numbers</h3>

The seed of the random number generator can be set here:

<p/><strong>
flag name="Pythia:setSeed" default="off"
</strong><br/>
Indicates whether a user-set seed should be used every time the 
<code>Pythia::init</code> routine is called. If off, the random number 
generator is initialized with its default seed at the beginning 
of the run, and never again. If on, each new <code>Pythia::init</code> 
call (should several be made in the same run) results in the random 
number being re-initialized, thereby possibly starting over with the 
same sequence, if you do not watch out.
  

<p/><strong>
mode name="Pythia:seed" default="-1" max="900000000"
</strong><br/>
The seed to be used, if <code>setSeed</code> is on.<br/>
A negative value gives the default seed,<br/> 
a value 0 gives a random seed based on the time, and<br/>
a value between 1 and 900,000,000 a unique different random number 
sequence.
  

<h3>Error Checks</h3>

There is also a few settings related to error checking.

<p/><strong>
flag name="Pythia:checkEvent" default="on"
</strong><br/>
When an event has been successfully generated, check that the 
final event record does not contain any unphysical particles, or 
nonconserved charge or energy-momentum. If this check fails, then
<code>pythia.next()</code> obtains the value <code>false</code>.
  

<p/><strong>
mode name="Pythia:nErrList" default="3"
</strong><br/>
The number of erroneous events, in the above check, for which 
information will be printed. After that, only the error counters
will be updated, and can be shown with a <code>pythia.statistics()</code> 
at the end of the run.
  

<p/><strong>
parm name="Pythia:epTolerance" default="1e-5"
</strong><br/>
Maximum allowed summed deviation of <i>E</i>, <i>p_x</i>, 
<i>p_y</i> and <i>p_z</i> between the incoming beams and the 
final state, as a fraction of the initial energy. (Unfortunetely 
roundoff errors do not scale linearly with the energy, and also have 
a very long tail. So while most events at lower energies may be correct 
to better than 1e-10, at LHC it does not have to signal any fundamental 
bug if also the default tolerance above is violated occasionally.)
