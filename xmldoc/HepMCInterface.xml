<h2>HepMC Interface</h2>

An interface to the HepMC <ref>Dob01</ref> standard event record 
format has been provided by M. Kirsanov. To use it, the relevant 
libraires need to be linked, as explained in the <code>README</code> 
file. Version 1 of the program requires that CLHEP is also linked,
for the handling of four-vectors, while version 2 is standalone.
This requires some adjustments in the interface code based on which 
version is going to be used. 

The (simple) procedure to translate PYTHIA 8 events into HepMC ones 
is illustrated in the <code>main21.c</code>, <code>main22.c</code>   
and <code>main23.c</code> main programs. At the core is a call to
the
<pre>
HepMC::I_Pythia8::fill_next_event( pythia.event, hepmcevt ) 
</pre>
routine, which takes a PYTHIA event as input and returns a HepMC one.
