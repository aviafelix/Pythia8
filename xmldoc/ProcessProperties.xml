<h2>Process Properties</h2>

Here is collected some possibilities to affect the generation of 
all internally implemented processes in one go, or some coherent
subset thereof. Phase space cuts appear on a special page.

<h3>Incoming partons</h3>

<code>InFlux</code> is base class for the combination of allowed incoming 
partons in a given process, and keeps track of parton densities and 
common weight factors (such as charge) required to give the process 
cross section.

<p/>
There is one useful degree of freedom in this class:
<modeopen name="InFlux:nQuark" default="5" min="0" max="5">
Number of allowed incoming quark flavours in the beams; a change 
to 4 would thus exclude <ei>b</ei> and <ei>bbar</ei> as incoming 
partons, etc.
</modeopen>

<p/>
There is also the possibility to obtain some documentation.
<flag name="InFlux:showChannels" default="off">
At initialization show which incoming flavours and flavour combinations
have beeen set up, process by process, along with initial weight 
(e.g. charges or CKM factors) assigned to each of them.
</flag>

<h3>Generic cross sections</h3>

<code>SigmaProcess</code> is base class for all hard processes 
implemented in PYTHIA 8. For <ei>2 -> 1</ei> processes it 
should give <ei>sigmaHat(sHat)</ei>, for <ei>2 -> 2</ei> ones 
<ei>d(sigmaHat(sHat, tHat))/d(tHat)</ei>. The matrix-element
coding is also used by the multiple-interactions machinery,
but with a separate choice of <ei>alpha_strong(M_Z^2)</ei> value
and running, and separate scale choices. Also, in <ei>2 -> 2</ei> 
processes where resonances are produced, their couplings and thereby 
their Breit-Wigner shapes are always evaluated with the resonance mass 
as scale, irrespective of the choices below.

<p/>
The size of QCD cross sections is mainly determined by 
<parm name="SigmaProcess:alphaSvalue" default="0.1265" 
min="0.06" max="0.25">
The <ei>alpha_strong</ei> value at scale <ei>M_Z^2</ei>. 
</parm>

<p/>
The actual value is then regulated by the running to the <ei>Q^2</ei> 
renormalization scale, at which <ei>alpha_strong</ei> is evaluated
<modepick name="SigmaProcess:alphaSorder" default="1" min="0" max="2">
Order at which <ei>alpha_strong</ei> runs,
<option value="0">zeroth order, i.e. <ei>alpha_strong</ei> is kept 
fixed.</option>
<option value="1">first order, which is the normal value.</option>
<option value="2">second order. Since other parts of the code do 
not go to second order there is no strong reason to use this option, 
but there is also nothing wrong with it.</option>
</modepick>

<p/>
QED interactions are regulated by the <ei>alpha_electromagnetic</ei>
value at the <ei>Q^2</ei> renormalization scale of an interaction. 
<modepick name="SigmaProcess:alphaEMorder" default="1" min="-1" max="1">
The running of <ei>alpha_em</ei> used in hard processes.
<option value="1">first-order running, constrained to agree with
<code>StandardModel:alphaEMmZ</code> at the <ei>Z^0</ei> mass.
</option>
<option value="0">zeroth order, i.e. <ei>alpha_em</ei> is kept 
fixed at its value at vanishing momentum transfer.</option>
<option value="-1">zeroth order, i.e. <ei>alpha_em</ei> is kept 
fixed, but at <code>StandardModel:alphaEMmZ</code>, i.e. its value
at the <ei>Z^0</ei> mass.
</option> 
</modepick>

<p/>
The <ei>Q^2</ei> renormalization scale is <ei>sHat</ei> for 
<ei>2 -> 1</ei> processes while there is a choice for <ei>2 -> 2</ei>
ones:  
<modepick name="SigmaProcess:renormScale" default="0" min="0" max="1">
The <ei>Q^2</ei> renormalization scale for <ei>2 -> 2</ei> processes.
<option value="0">the product of the transverse masses of the two
outgoing particles, i.e. <ei>sqrt((pT^2 + m3^2) * (pT2 + m4^2))</ei>.
</option>
<option value="1">the average of the squared transverse masses, 
i.e. <ei>pT^2 + 0.5 * (m3^2 + m4^2)</ei>. Useful for comparisons 
with PYTHIA 6.
</option>
</modepick>

<p/>
It is also possible to shift the choice by a global factor.
<parm name="SigmaProcess:renormMult" default="1." min="0.1" max="10.">
The <ei>Q^2</ei> renormalization scale for <ei>2 -> 1</ei> and
<ei>2 -> 2</ei> processes is multiplied by this factor relative to the
scale described above. Should be use sparingly for <ei>2 -> 1</ei>
processes. 

<p/>
Corresponding options exist for the <ei>Q^2</ei> factorization scale
used as argument in PDF's. Again <ei>sHat</ei> is scale for <ei>2 -> 1</ei> 
processes while there is a choice for <ei>2 -> 2</ei> ones:
<modepick name="SigmaProcess:factorScale" default="0" min="0" max="1">
The <ei>Q^2</ei> factorization scale for <ei>2 -> 2</ei> processes.
<option value="0">the smaller of the squared transverse masses of the two
outgoing particles, i.e. <ei>pT^2 + min(m3^2 + m4^2)</ei>.
</option>
<option value="1">the average of the squared transverse masses, 
i.e. <ei>pT^2 + 0.5 * (m3^2 + m4^2)</ei>. Useful for comparisons 
with PYTHIA 6.
</option>
</modepick>

<p/>
It is also possible to shift the choice by a global factor.
<parm name="SigmaProcess:factorMult" default="1." min="0.1" max="10.">
The <ei>Q^2</ei> factorization scale for <ei>2 -> 1</ei> and
<ei>2 -> 2</ei> processes is multiplied by this factor relative to the
scale described above. Should be use sparingly for <ei>2 -> 1</ei>
processes.  

<h3>Special cross sections</h3>

Here settings that affect some special group of processes, but not all.

<modeopen name="SigmaProcess:nQuark" default="3" min="0" max="5">
Number of allowed outgoing new quark flavours in 
<ei>q qbar -> q' qbar'</ei> and <ei>g g-> q qbar</ei> processes, 
where quarks are treated as massless in the matrix-element expressions 
(but correctly in the phase space). It is thus assumed that <ei>c cbar</ei> 
and <ei>b bbar</ei> are added separately with masses taken into account. 
A change to 4 would also include <ei>c cbar</ei> in the massless 
approximation, etc. 
</modeopen>

<modeopen name="SigmaProcess:nQuarkInLoop" default="5" min="3" max="6">
Number of quark flavours included in the box graphs resposible for 
<ei>g g -> g gamma</ei> and <ei>g g-> gamma gamma</ei> processes.
Owing to the complexity if the massive expressions, quarks are treated 
as massless. The default value should be applicable in the range of 
transverse momenta above the <ei>b</ei> mass but below the <ei>t</ei> one.
</modeopen>

<modepick name="SigmaProcess:gmZmode" default="0" min="0" max="2">
Choice of full <ei>gamma^*/Z^0</ei> structure or not in relevant 
processes.
<option value="0">full <ei>gamma^*/Z^0</ei> structure,
with interference included.</option>
<option value="1">only pure <ei>gamma^*</ei> contribution.</option>
<option value="2">only pure <ei>Z^0</ei> contribution.</option>
</modepick>
