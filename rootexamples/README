This directory contains files contributed by Rene Brun and 
Axel Naumann, which illustrate how ROOT commands can be used 
inside PYTHIA code. You should read the "ROOT usage" page 
in the manual to understand the function of the files, and 
how to set up the environment in which they can be used.

-------------------------------------------------------------

For FastJet use, add the following lines to the Makefile:

CXXFLAGS += -I/Path_to_FastJet/include
-L$(PYTHIA8)/lib -lpythia8 -llhapdfdummy -L/Path_to_FastJet/lib -lfastjet

where "Path_to_FastJet" is the directory where FastJet was installed.
Finally, add to your ".bashrc" file the following line:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=//Path_to_FastJet/lib:LD_LIBRARY_PATH

and type "source .bashrc" after the changes.
