<h2>Glossary</h2>

<dl>

<dt>BR</dt>
<dd>Beam Remnants; not much used since it may be confused with 
Branching Ratio</dd>

<dt>BSM</dt>
<dd>Beyond-the-Standard-Model physics, as a generic term for anything
not contained within the SM</dd>

<dt>FSR</dt>
<dd>Final-State Radiation, implemented in terms of timelike showers</dd>

<dt>ISR</dt>
<dd>Initial-State Radiation, implemented in terms of spacelike showers</dd>

<dt>MI</dt>
<dd>Multiple Interactions, i.e. several (more or less) independent 
parton-parton subcollisions as part of a hadron-hadron event (sometimes
also called MPI, with P for parton or parton-parton)</dd>

<dt>MSSM</dt>
<dd>Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model</dd>

<dt>PDF</dt>
<dd>Parton Distribution Function (alternatively Parton Density 
Function)</dd>

<dt>PDG code</dt>
<dd>a scheme for assigning unique integers, particle identity codes,
to known and hypothetical particles; code rules and tables are published 
in the RPP (see below).</dd>

<dt>pileup</dt>
<dd>several hadron-hadron collisions in a bunch crossing</dd>

<dt>RPP</dt>
<dd>Review of Particle Physics, the biannual review by the ParticleData Group
(PDG) from which many Standard-Model parameter values and much particle data 
has been taken (but, given the poor data on many hadron resonances, a lot of
extra (guess)work is needed)</dd>

<dt>setting</dt>
<dd>collectively used to denote all the boolean <code>flag</code>, 
integer <code>mode</code>, double-precision <code>parm</code>
and string <code>word</code> variables that can be set by the user 
to steer the behaviour of a run; normally particle data are considered
separately but clearly are closely related</dd>

<dt>SM</dt>
<dd>the Standard Model of particle physics</dd>

<dt>SUSY</dt>
<dd>SUperSYmmetry</dd>
