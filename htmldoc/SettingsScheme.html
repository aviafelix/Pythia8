<h2>The Settings Scheme</h2>

The <code>Settings</code> class keeps track of all the flags, modes, 
parameters and words in the program. As such, it serves the other program 
elements from one central repository. Accessing it allows the user to 
modify the behaviour of the program. The <code>Settings</code> class is 
purely static, i.e. you can interact with it directly by 
<code>Settings::command(argument)</code>. 
However, a <code>settings</code> object of the <code>Settings</code> class 
is a public member of the <code>Pythia</code> class, so an alternative 
notation would be <code>pythia.settings.command(argument)</code>,
assuming that <code>pythia</code> is an instance of the <code>Pythia</code> 
class. Further, for the most frequent user tasks, <code>Pythia</code> 
methods have been defined, so that <code>pythia.command(argument)</code> 
would work, see further below.

<p/>
The central section on this page is the Operation one. The preceding 
concepts section is there mainly to introduce the basic structure and 
the set of properties that can be accessed. The subsequent sections 
provide a complete listing of the existing public methods, which most 
users probably will have little interaction with.

<h3>Concepts</h3>

We distinguish four kinds of user-modifiable variables, by the way
they have to be stored:
<ol>
<li>Flags are on/off switches, and are stored as <code>bool</code>.</li>
<li>Modes corresponds to a finite enumeration of separate options,
   and are stored as <code>int</code>.</li>
<li>Parameters take a continuum of values, and are stored as 
<code>double</code>. The shorthand notation parm is used in the C++ 
code and XML tags, so that all four kinds are represented by
four-letter type names.</li>
<li>Words are simple character strings and are stored as 
<code>string</code>. No blanks or double quotation marks (") may 
appear inside a word, the former to simplify parsing of an input file
and the latter not to cause conflicts with XML attribute delimiters.
Currently the main application is to store file names.</li>
</ol>

<p/>
In general, each variable stored in <code>Settings</code> is associated 
with four kinds of information:
<ul>
<li>The variable name, of the form <code>class:name</code> 
(or <code>file:name</code>, usually these agree), e.g. 
<code>TimeShower:pTmin</code>. The class/file part usually identifies 
the <code>.xml</code> file where the variable is defined, and the part of 
the program where it is used, but such a connection cannot be strictly
upheld, since e.g. the same variable may be used in a few different
cases (even if most of them are not).</li> 
<li>The default value, set in the original declaration, and intended
to represent a reasonable choice.</li> 
<li>The current value, which differs from the default when the user so 
requests.</li>
<li>An allowed range of values, represented by meaningful
minimum and maximum values. This has no sense for a <code>flag</code> 
or a <code>word</code> (and is not used there), is usually rather 
well-defined for a <code>mode</code>, but less so for a <code>parm</code>. 
Often the allowed range exaggerates the degree of our current knowledge, 
so as not to restrict too much what the user can do. One may choose 
not to set the lower or upper limit, in which case the range is 
open-ended.</li>   
</ul>

<p/>
Technically, the <code>Settings</code> class is implemented with the 
help of four separate maps, one for each kind of variable, with the 
variable <code>name</code> used as key. 

<h3>Operation</h3>
    
The normal flow of setting values is:

<ol>

<p/> <li>
When a <code>Pythia</code> object <code>pythia </code>is created, 
the member <code>pythia.settings</code> is asked to scan the files
listed in the <code>Index.xml</code> file in the <code>xmldoc</code> 
subdirectory.

<p/>
In all of the files scanned, lines beginning with 
<code>&lt;flag</code>, <code>&lt;mode</code>, <code>&lt;parm</code> 
or <code>&lt;word</code> are identified, and the information on 
such a line is used to define a new flag, mode, parameter or word. 
To exemplify, consider a line
<pre>
&lt;parm name="TimeShower:pTmin" default="0.5" min="0.1" max="2.0">
</pre> 
which appears in the <code>TimeShower.xml</code> file, and there
defines a parameter <code>TimeShower:pTmin</code> with default value 
0.5 GeV and allowed variation in the range 0.1 - 2.0 GeV. The min 
and max values are optional.
<br/><b>Important:</b> the values in the <code>.xml</code> files should 
not be changed, except by the PYTHIA authors. Any changes should be 
done with the help of the methods described below.
</li>

<p/> <li>
Between the creation of the <code>Pythia</code> object and the 
<code>init</code> call for it, you may use several alternative 
methods to modify some of the default values. 

<p/> 
a) Inside your main program you can directly set values with
<pre>
    pythia.readString(string) 
</pre>
where both the variable name and the value are contained inside
the character string, separated by blanks and/or a =, e.g. 
<pre>
    pythia.readString("TimeShower:pTmin = 1.0"); 
</pre>
The match of the name to the database is case-insensitive. Names 
that do not match an existing variable are ignored. A warning is
printed, however, unless an optional second argument <code>false</code> 
is used. Strings beginning with a non-alphanumeric character, like 
# or !, are assumed to be comments and are not processed at all. 
Values below the minimum or above the maximum are set at 
the respective border. For <code>bool</code> values, the following 
notation may be used interchangeably: 
<code>true = on = yes = ok = 1</code>, while everything else gives 
<code>false</code> (including but not limited to 
<code>false</code>, <code>off</code>, <code>no</code> and 0).<br/> 

<p/> 
b) The <code>Pythia</code> <code>readString(string)</code> method 
actually does not do changes itself, but sends on the string either 
to the <code>Settings</code> class or to <code>ParticleData</code>. 
If desired, it is possible to communicate
directly with the corresponding <code>Settings</code> method:
<pre>
    pythia.settings.readString("TimeShower:pTmin = 1.0"); 
</pre>
In this case, changes intended for <code>ParticleData</code> 
would not be understood.

<p/> 
c) Underlying the <code>settings.readString(string)</code> method are 
the settings-type-sensitive commands in the <code>Settings</code>, that 
are split by names containing <code>flag</code>, <code>mode</code>, 
<code>parm</code> or <code>word</code>. Thus, the example now reads
<pre>
    pythia.settings.parm("TimeShower:pTmin", 1.0); 
</pre>
Boolean values should here be given as <code>true</code> or 
<code>false</code> i.e. there is less flexibility in the lower-level 
methods.

<p/> 
At the same level, there are several different methods available.
These are included in the full description below, but normally the user 
should have no need for them. 

<p/>
d) A simpler and more useful way is to collect all your changes
in a separate file, with one line per change, e.g. 
<pre>
    TimeShower:pTmin = 1.0
</pre>
Each line is read in as a string and processed with the methods already
introduced.

The file can be read by the 
<pre>
    pythia.readFile(fileName); 
</pre>
method (or an <code>istream</code> instead of a <code>fileName</code>). 
The file can freely mix commands to the <code>Settings</code> and 
<code>ParticleData</code> classes, and so is preferable. Lines with 
settings are handled by calls to the 
<code>pythia.settings.readString(string)</code> method. Again, an optional 
second argument <code>false</code> allows you to switch off warning 
messages for unknown variables.
</li>

<p/> <li>
In the <code>Pythia init</code> call, many of the various other program  
elements are initialized, making use of the current values in the database. 
Once initialized, the common <code>Settings</code> database is likely not 
consulted again by these routines. It is therefore not productive to do 
further changes in mid-run: at best nothing changes, at worst you may 
set up inconsistencies. 

<p/>
A routine <code>reInit(fileName)</code> is provided, and can be used to 
zero all the maps and reinitialize  from scratch. Such a call might be 
required if several <code>Pythia</code> objects are created in the same run, 
and requested to have different values - by default the <code>init()</code> 
call is only made the first time. However, a more economical solution 
is then offered by <code>resetAll()</code>, which sets all variables to 
their default values.
</li> 

<p/> <li>
You may at any time obtain a listing of all variables in the 
database by calling  
<pre>
    pythia.settings.listAll();
</pre>
The listing is strictly alphabetical, which at least means that names
from the same file are kept together, but otherwise may not be so 
well-structured: important and unimportant ones will appear mixed.
A more relevant alternative is 
<pre>
    pythia.settings.listChanged();
</pre>
where you will only get those variables that differ from their 
defaults. Or you can use 
<pre>
    pythia.settings.list("string");
</pre>
where only those variables with names that contain the string 
(case-insensitive match) are listed. Thus, with a string 
<code>shower</code>, the shower-related variables would be shown.
</li>

<p/> <li>
The above listings are in a tabular form that cannot be read
back in. Assuming you want to save all changed settings (maybe because
you read in changes from several files), you can do that by calling
<pre>
    pythia.settings.writeFile(fileName);
</pre>
This file could then directly be read in by 
<code>readFile(fileName)</code> in a subsequent (identical) run.
A second argument <code>true</code> would print all settings, not
only the changed ones. Further, the first argument can be replaced by
(a reference to) an <code>ostream</code>, by default <code>cout</code>.   
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Methods</h3>

The complete list of methods and arguments is as follows. Most of the 
ones of interest to the user have already been mentioned above. 
Others can be used, but the same functionality is better achieved
by higher-level routines. Some are part of the internal machinery,
and should not be touched by user. 

<p/>
Note that there is no <code>Settings::readFile(...)</code> method. 
The intention is that you should use <code>Pythia::readFile(...)</code>.
It parses and decides which individual lines should be sent on to 
<code>Settings::readString(...)</code>.

<a name="method1"></a>
<p/><strong>Settings::Settings() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
the constructor, which takes no arguments. Internal.
  

<a name="method2"></a>
<p/><strong>static bool Settings::initPtr(Info* infoPtrIn) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
initialize pointer to error-message database. Internal.
  

<a name="method3"></a>
<p/><strong>static bool Settings::init(string startFile = &quot;../xmldoc/Index.xml&quot;, bool append = false, ostream& os = cout) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
read in the database from the files listed in the
<code>startFile</code> file. Nothing will be done if this method has 
already been called once, unless <code>append = true</code>. By default
<code>cout</code> is used for error printout. Returns <code>false</code>
if fails.
  

<a name="method4"></a>
<p/><strong>static bool Settings::reInit(string startFile = &quot;../xmldoc/Index.xml&quot;) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
overwrite the existing database by reading from the specified file,
like with <code>init(...)</code>. Returns <code>false</code>
if fails.
  

<a name="method5"></a>
<p/><strong>static bool Settings::readString(string line, bool warn = true, ostream& os = cout) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
read in a string, and change the relevant quantity in the database.
Returns <code>false</code> if fails. Then also prints an error on
<code>os</code> unless <code>warn = false</code>.  
  

<a name="method6"></a>
<p/><strong>static bool Settings::writeFile(string toFile, bool writeAll = false) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>static bool Settings::writeFile(ostream& os = cout, bool writeAll = false) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
write current settings to a file or to an <code>ostream</code>.
Normally only settings that have ben changed are written, but with
<code>writeAll = true</code> all settings are output.
Returns <code>false</code> if fails.
  

<a name="method7"></a>
<p/><strong>static void Settings::listAll(ostream& os = cout) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>static void Settings::listChanged(ostream& os = cout) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>static void Settings::list(string match, ostream& os = cout) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
list all or changed settings, or ones where the settings name contains
the <code>match</code> (sub)string (case-insensitive). 
  

<a name="method8"></a>
<p/><strong>static void Settings::resetAll() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
reset all current values to their defaults.
  

<a name="method9"></a>
<p/><strong>static bool Settings::isFlag(string key) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>static bool Settings::isMode(string key) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>static bool Settings::isParm(string key) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>static bool Settings::isWord(string key) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
return <code>true</code> if an entry of the given name and kind 
exists, else <code>false</code>.
  

<a name="method10"></a>
<p/><strong>static void Settings::addFlag(string key, bool default) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>static void Settings::addMode(string key, int default, bool hasMin, bool hasMax, int min, int max) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>static void Settings::addParm(string key, double default, bool hasMin, bool hasMax, double min, double max) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>static void Settings::addWord(string key, string default) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
add an entry of the respective kind to the database. The name and default
value always has to be supplied, for <code>Mode</code> and 
<code>Word</code> additionally if lower and/or upper limits are to be 
imposed and, if so, what those limit are.
  

<a name="method11"></a>
<p/><strong>static bool Settings::flag(string key) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>static int Settings::mode(string key) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>static double Settings::parm(string key) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>static string Settings::word(string key) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
return the current value of the respective setting. If the name 
does not exist in the database, a value <code>false</code>,
<code>0</code>, <code>0.</code> and <code>&quot; &quot;</code> 
is returned, respectively.
  

<a name="method12"></a>
<p/><strong>static void Settings::flag(string key, bool now) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>static void Settings::mode(string key, int now) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>static void Settings::parm(string key, double now) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>static void Settings::word(string key, string now) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
change the current value of the respective setting to the provided 
new value. If lower or upper limits have been set, input values 
outside the allowed range are reinterpreted as being a the nearest 
limit.
  

<a name="method13"></a>
<p/><strong>static void Settings::forceMode(string key, int now) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>static void Settings::forceParm(string key, double now) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
as above, but do not check lower and upper limits, so that the current 
value can be put outside the intended borders.
  

<a name="method14"></a>
<p/><strong>static void Settings::resetFlag(string key) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>static void Settings::resetMode(string key) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>static void Settings::resetParm(string key) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>static void Settings::resetWord(string key) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
reset the current value to the default one.
