<h2>Access PYTHIA 6 Processes</h2>

In order to give access to the Fortran PYTHIA process library
at runtime (and not only by writing/reading event files)
an interface is provided to C++. This interface is residing in 
<code>Pythia6Interface.h</code>, and in addition the PYTHIA 6 library
must be linked. The latter should normally be the most recent 
Fortran PYTHIA version, but must be at least 6.314, since this is 
the first version that allows processes to be output in the Les 
Houches format (and not only input).

<p/>
The  routines interfaced are
<ul>
<li><code>pygive(command)</code> to give in a command to change a 
setting, e.g. to decide which processes should be generated,
<li><code>pyinit( frame, beam, target, wIn)</code> to initialize 
the event generation chain,</li>
<li><code>pyupin()</code> to fill this initialization information 
in the <code>HEPRUP</code> commonblock,</li>
<li><code>pyupev()</code> to generate the next hard process and 
fill the event information in the <code>HEPEUP</code> commonblock,</li>
<li><code>pylist( mode)</code> to list the event at the process 
level,</li>
<li><code>pystat( mode)</code> to print statistics on the event 
generation process.</li>
</ul> 
Details on allowed arguments are given in the PYTHIA 6.4 manual.

<p/>
These methods can be used in context of the  
<a href="LesHouchesAccord.html" target="page"><code>LHAinitFortran</code> and 
<code>LHAevntFortran</code></a> classes. The existing code there 
takes care of converting <code>HEPRUP</code> 
and <code>HEPEUP</code> commonblock information from Fortran to C++,
and of making it available to the PYTHIA 8 methods. What needs to be 
supplied are the two <code>LHAinitFortran::fillHepRup()</code> and
<code>LHAinitFortran::fillHepEup()</code> methods. The first can
contain an arbitrary number of <code>pygive(...)</code>, followed
by <code>pyinit(...)</code> and <code>pyupin()</code> in that order.
The second only needs to contain <code>pyupev()</code>. Finally,
the use of <code>pylist(...)</code> and <code>pystat(...)</code>
is entirely optional, and calls are best put directly in the
main program.

<p/>
This means that all other Fortran routines have not been interfaced
and cannot be accessed directly from the C++ code; there is no need
for them in the current setup.
 
<p/>
An example of a <code>fillHepRup()</code> method to set up 
<i>Z^0</i> production at LHC, with masses above 50 GeV, would be
<pre>
bool LHAinitFortran::fillHepRup() { 
  Pythia6Interface::pygive("msel = 11"); 
  Pythia6Interface::pygive("ckin(1) = 50."); 
  Pythia6Interface::pyinit("cms","p","p",14000.);   
  Pythia6Interface::pyupin();
  return true;
}
</pre>
and the process-generic <code>fillHepEup()</code> method would be
<pre>
bool LHAevntFortran::fillHepEup() { 
  Pythia6Interface::pyupev();
  return true;
}
</pre>
Note that, of all parameters that could be set with the 
<code>PYGIVE</code>, only those that influence the generation of the 
hard processes have any impact, since this is the only part of the 
Fortran code that is used. Also, if you want to set many parameters,
you can easily collect them in one file (separate from PYTHIA 8
input) and parse that file.

<p/>
All hard PYTHIA 6 processes should be available for full generation
in PYTHIA 8, at least to the extent that they are defined for beams 
of protons and antiprotons, which are the only ones fully implemented 
in PYTHIA 8 so far. Soft processes, i.e. elastic and diffractive 
scattering, as well as minimum-bias events, require a different 
kinematics machinery, and can only be generated with the internal 
PYTHIA 8 processes.

<p/>
Finally, note that it is currently not possible to mix processes from 
PYTHIA 6 with those from PYTHIA 8. This will be fixed later.

<p/>
A simple example is found in <code>main11.cc</code>, and another
with parsed input in <code>main12.cc</code>.
