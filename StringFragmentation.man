          =================== 

The StringFragmentation class handles fragmentation according to the 
Lund string model [1, 2], in cases where the colour-singlet invariant 
mass is big enough that at least two particles can be comfortably 
produced. If not, the MiniStringFragmentation machinery is invoked
instead.

Most of the parameters of string fragmentation are related to the 
choice of flavours and of longitudinal and transverse momenta. 
Separate classes for these tasks have been put in the
FragmentationFlavZpT file, since they are also partly used by 
the MiniStringFragmentation and ParticleDecays classes.

   The StringFragmentation class
   -----------------------------

This class drives the fragmentation process of a single partonic system,
making use of the above-mentioned classes for specific tasks. Most 
parameters therefore are located in FragmentationFlavZpT.man.

Three parameters describe how the fragmentation process is stopped:

<parameter> StringFragmentation:stopMass = 1.0 min = 0.0 max = 2.0
Is used to define a W_min = m_q1 + m_q2 + stopMass,
where m_q1 and m_q2 are the masses of the two current endpoint
quarks or diquarks. 

<parameter> StringFragmentation:stopNewFlav = 2.0 min = 0.0 max = 2.0
Add to W_min stopNewFlav * m_q_last, where q_last is the last qqbar
pair produced between the final two hadrons.

<parameter> StringFragmentation:stopSmear = 0.2 min = 0.0 max = 0.5
The W_min above is then smeared uniformly in the range
W_min_smeared = W_min * [ 1 - stopSmear, 1 + stopSmear ].

This W_min_smeared is then compared with the current remaining
W_transverse to determine if there is energy left for further
particle production. If not, i.e. if W_transverse < W_min_smeared,
the final two particles are produced from what is currently left,
if possible. (If not, the fragmentation process is started over.)

Four parameters are specific to the fragmentation of junction 
systems [3]:

<parameter> StringFragmentation:eNormJunction = 2.0 min = 0.5 max = 10.
For each of the three string legs of a junction, the pull is defined
as a weighed sum of the momenta on each leg, where the weight is 
exp(- eSum / eNormJunction), with eSum the summed energy of all 
partons closer to the junction than the currently considered one
(in the junction rest frame). Should in principle be (close to) 
sqrt((1 + a) / b), with a and b the parameters of the Lund symmetric 
fragmentation function. 

<parameter> StringFragmentation:eBothLeftJunction = 1.0 min = 0.5
Retry (up to 10 times) when the first two considered strings in to a 
junction both have a remaining energy (in the junction rest frame) 
above this number.

<parameter> StringFragmentation:eMaxLeftJunction = 10.0 min = 0. 
Retry (up to 10 times) when the first two considered strings in to a 
junction has a highest remaining energy (in the junction rest frame) 
above a random energy evenly distributed between eBothLeftJunction and
eBothLeftJunction + eMaxLeftJunction (drawn anew for each test).

<parameter> StringFragmentation:eMinLeftJunction = 0.2 min = 0. 
Retry (up to 10 times) when the invariant mass-squared of the final leg 
and the leftover momentum of the first two treated legs falls below 
eMinLeftJunction times the energy of the final leg (in the junction 
rest frame).
