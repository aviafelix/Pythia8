! File: main06.cmnd
! This file contains commands to be read in for a Pythia8 run. 
! Lines not beginning with a letter or digit are comments.
! Names are case-insensitive  -  but spellings-sensitive!
! The changes here are illustrative, not always physics-motivated.

! 1) Settings that could be used in a main program, if desired.
Main:idBeamA = 2212                ! first beam, p = 2212, pbar = -2212
Main:idBeamB = -2212               ! second beam, p = 2212, pbar = -2212
Main:eCM = 1960.                   ! CM energy of collision, LHC
Main:numberOfEvents = 20000        ! number of events to generate
Main:numberToList = 1              ! number of events to print
Main:timesToShow = 20              ! show how far along run is this many times
Main:timesAllowErrors = 10         ! abort run after this many flawed events
Main:showChangedSettings = on      ! print changed flags/modes/parameters
#Main:showAllSettings = on          ! print all flags/modes/parameters
#Main:showChangedParticleData = on  ! print changed particle and decay data
#Main:showAllParticleData = on      ! print all particle and decay data

! 2) Settings for process generation internal to Pythia8.
SoftQCD:elastic = on               ! elastic scattering
SoftQCD:singleDiffractive = on      ! single diffractive scattering
SoftQCD:doubleDiffractive = on      ! double diffractive scattering

! 3) Switch off some key components of the simulation, for comparisons.
#Pythia:afterProcessLevel = off      ! stop after hard process 
PartonLevel:MI = off               ! no need to initialize MI, since not used
